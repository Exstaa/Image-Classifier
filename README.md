## Fruit/Vegetable Image Classifier
## Overview
This project implements a deep learning-based image classifier capable of identifying various fruits and vegetables. It utilizes neural networks to classify input images into predefined categories of fruits and vegetables.

## Features
Classifies input images into fruit or vegetable categories.
Supports a variety of fruits and vegetables.
Utilizes deep learning techniques for classification.
Provides accuracy metrics to evaluate the performance of the classifier.
## Requirements
Python (>=3.6)
Jupyter Notebook
TensorFlow
Keras
OpenCV
Numpy
Matplotlib
Pandas
## Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your_username/fruit-vegetable-classifier.git
Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
## Usage
Open the Jupyter Notebook fruit_vegetable_classifier.ipynb.
Follow the instructions provided in the notebook.
Upload the image you want to classify.
Run the notebook cells to preprocess the image and classify it.
View the predicted category along with confidence scores.
## Model Training
The classifier model is trained on a dataset containing labeled images of fruits and vegetables.
The notebook includes code for training the model. You can train the model on your own dataset or fine-tune the existing model.
## Evaluation
The performance of the classifier is evaluated using accuracy metrics.
You can evaluate the classifier on a separate test dataset to assess its performance.
